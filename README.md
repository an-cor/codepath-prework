## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

List of favorite 3 apps and features that make them my favorite app

Reddit

- Personalized content like communities you follow, popular on the app, news or latest
- Save content like posts or specific comments for later watch/read
- Search for specific topics with very accurate responses

Instagram

- Personalized content relative to me like age or hobbies
- Share different content of myself like notes, story posts, account posts
- Show location based content. Can go through a map and see what is happening live around me

Sudoku.com

- Highlights regions like rows, columns or square while selecting a number
- Different difficulty modes (Easy, Medium. Hard, Expert, Master, Extreme)
- Will keep track and show you your own stats after finishing a game (Score, Timing, Win Rate, Streak)

App idea that I would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. 

I exercise often and I often to timed activities in my exercises. In a lot of apps I have found, there are timers usually fixed for certain time intervals or specific, pre-made exercise routines. I would like to build a timer app made for specifically for exercising with dynamic setting on how to make a timer. It would have the functionality to be modified to follow a set amount of minutes|seconds with x amount of repititions. Multiple timers could be run at the same time. A timer could be set to start at a specific real time (say at 16:00 an 8 minute timer starts). Color would be an integral part of the app to give visual aid for any visually impaired users. It would have a very straightforward UI because complicated or "cool" UIs make a very simple app be very difficult to use. Of course, this app could be used for other things that require precise timing or multiple timers (like cooking) but I would want to make it intuitive for any athlete optimizing their exercise routines. 


## Notes

Challenges encountered while building the app:

Struggled with the UI of the XCode IDE. App logic and implementation was straightforward but finding where the editing buttons were was trickier. It took me loner to change things like the button background or the text font than actually choosing the color or the text.
